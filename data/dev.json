      "Speaker 3: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",
      "Speaker 2: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!",
      "Speaker 1: How is it you?",
      "Speaker 2: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.",

      "Speaker 2: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh.",
      "Speaker 1: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",
      "Speaker 2: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'",
      "Speaker 1: Hang up, hang up.",
      "Speaker 2: 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",
      "Speaker 3: Is anybody else scared?",
      "Speaker 2: 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.",
      "Speaker 3: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!",

For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don\u2019t say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I\u2019m-I\u2019m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can\u2019t because she\u2019s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she\u2019s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn\u2019t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here\u2019s to mom and dad! Whatever!",

      "Speaker 3: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.",
      "Speaker 1: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.",
      "Speaker 3: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?",
